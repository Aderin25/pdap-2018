#+TITLE: Practical Data Analysis with Python

  This homework exercise gives you the opportunity to familiarize
  yourself with the Git process of collaborating with other people.
  While this homework assignment is optional, I still strongly
  encourage you to participate, since later on, we will use this exact
  same process to obtain and submit your exam homework projects.  So
  this assignment gives you a free learning opportunity to prepare for
  the upcoming graded homework projects.

* Prerequisites

  This homework exercise assumes that you successfully completed the
  first homework exercise; most notably, you will need a working [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]]
  setup and your [[https://github.com][Github]] account.

  
* The Git workflow

  The basic Git workflow is described in the chapter [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project][GitHub -
  Contributing to a Project]] of the [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2][Pro Git book]].
  
  On that page, all the steps on the GitHub website and all the Git
  commands you need are described.  In our case, you need to

  1. Login to the GitHub website
  2. Go to the course repository https://github.com/iup-bremen/pdap-2018
  3. Create a /Fork/ of the repository
  4. Clone your fork of the project to your computer:
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       git clone git@github.com:YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/pdap-2018.git
     #+END_SRC
  5. Create a branch for this homework assignment:
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       git checkout -b homework2_YOURLASTNAME
     #+END_SRC
     One word of caution (this only applies to the PDAP-2018 course
     repository): Make sure to not modify the /master/ branch; always
     checkout a new branch before modifying any files in the
     repository. Especially, *never* commit anything to the /master/
     branch of this repository, as this will complicate future updates
     to the course repository.
  6. Complete the exercises in the homework notebook (see [[*Basic Python in the Notebook][below]])
  7. Commit the changes you made to the notebook file:
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       git add homework/PDAP2018_Homework-02_YOURLASTNAME.ipynb
       git commit [...]
     #+END_SRC
  8. Push your homework branch to GitHub:
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
       git push origin homework2_YOURLASTNAME
     #+END_SRC
  9. On the GitHub website, you will see that GitHub 'noticed' that
     you pushed the branch; you can now press the green /Compare & pull
     request/ button
     
  Et voil√† -- you submitted your homework \smiley{}
  

* Basic Python in the Notebook

  In the course repository, you will a file
  =homework/PDAP2018_Homework-02_template.ipynb=.  This is the Jupyter
  notebook file that contains your homework assignment.  Make a copy
  of that file, called =PDAP2018_Homework-02_YOURLASTNAME.ipynb=, and
  also place it in the directory =homework/= in the repository.
  
  Now, open this new file in JupyterLab (or the classic Jupyter
  Notebook, whatever you prefer) and follow the instructions given in
  that file.
  
  While working on the Notebook, don't forget to /save/ the file
  regularly.
