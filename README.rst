This course aims to be a very practical introduction to using a computer in
scientific data analysis, using the Python_  programming language. The course will
be most beneficial to third semester students, as they will be able to directly
apply the newly learned techniques in their M.Sc. thesis work; of course,
interested and motivated students can also join in their first semester.

.. Python: https://www.python.org/

The course will be accessible to all students, as it will not make any
assumptions on the students' computer environment, i.e., all topics will be
explained for all relevant operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux).

**Participants are expected to bring their own laptops, as the course
contains large parts of practical work.**

The first part of the course will touch on the following subjects:

- /But this worked yesterday, before I made some changes .../, or: an
  introduction to version control.
- Getting started: How to setup your own computer for data analysis in Python.
- Hands-on introduction to the Python scientific ecosystem: Arrays and
  mathematical operations.
- Labeled arrays, or how to intuitively work with data.
- Reading and writing data in common file formats.
- Making both beautiful and meaningful plots from data.
- An overview of the most common special-topic libraries for all research areas
  covered by the /pep/ program.

In its last sessions, the course will focus on a practical introduction to the
most common data analysis tasks, like, among others, curve fitting, parameter
estimation, and correlation analysis.

Every week, there will be 2 hours of course (approx. 1 hour lecture + 1 hour
practical exercises). There will be weekly homework excercises, plus two graded
homework projects.


Reading material
================

During this course, we will make use of free online material.  Each lecture will
contain large parts of practical exercises, and relevant reading material will
be announced in each lecture.

The following books are generally a good introduction into using Python for
scientific computing, but I strongly advise to check out the free online
material first, before investing into them.
